# Voice Assistant Application

## Description

This Python-based voice assistant application provides a range of functionalities, including text-to-speech, speech recognition, web browsing, Wikipedia searches, webcam access, and screenshot capture. It utilizes several Python libraries to interact with the user through voice commands and perform various tasks on the computer.

## Features

- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts text responses into spoken words.
- **Speech Recognition**: Captures and processes voice commands.
- **Wikipedia Search**: Retrieves and reads summaries from Wikipedia.
- **Web Browsing**: Opens Google and YouTube, performs searches.
- **Webcam Access**: Opens the webcam and displays the video feed.
- **Screenshot Capture**: Takes screenshots and saves them with a specified filename.
- **System Commands**: Executes system commands like opening/closing applications, shutting down, and more.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You will also need to install several Python libraries. This project has been tested on Windows systems; adjustments may be needed for other operating systems.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voice-assistant.git
   cd voice-assistant
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**: Use `pip` to install the necessary libraries. Run the following commands:

   ```bash
   pip install pyttsx3
   pip install SpeechRecognition
   pip install wikipedia-api
   pip install pywhatkit
   pip install opencv-python
   pip install pyautogui
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**: Execute the script from your terminal or command prompt.

   ```bash
   python voice_assistant.py
   ```

2. **Interact with the Assistant**: The assistant will greet you and wait for your commands. Speak into the microphone to give commands such as:
   - "Open Google"
   - "Search on YouTube for cats"
   - "Take a screenshot"
   - "Open camera"

   The assistant will respond with actions based on your commands.

## Troubleshooting

- **Microphone Issues**: Ensure your microphone is set up correctly and accessible to the application. Check microphone permissions.
- **Library Installation Problems**: Verify that you have Python 3.x and `pip` installed. Re-run the installation commands if you encounter issues.
- **System Commands**: The script uses system-specific commands (e.g., `taskkill` for Windows). Adapt commands if running on macOS or Linux.
