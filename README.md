# Voice Assistant using Python

This is a simple voice assistant built using Python, which can perform tasks like web searches, Wikipedia queries, opening applications, taking screenshots, and controlling system features such as shutting down, restarting, or locking the system.

## Features
- **Voice Recognition:** Recognizes user commands via speech using `SpeechRecognition` library.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Converts responses and system feedback to speech using `pyttsx3`.
- **Web Operations:** Search Google, play YouTube videos, and perform Google searches using `webbrowser` and `pywhatkit`.
- **Wikipedia Search:** Fetch summaries from Wikipedia using the `wikipedia` module.
- **System Control:** Commands to open/close Chrome, shutdown, restart, lock the system, and more.
- **Camera:** Open the system's webcam and display the feed using `OpenCV`.
- **Screenshots:** Capture and save screenshots using `pyautogui`.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3 installed along with the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition wikipedia webbrowser pywhatkit opencv-python pyautogui
```

### Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/voice-assistant-python.git
   ```

2. Run the `voice_assistant.py`:
   ```bash
   python voice_assistant.py
   ```

## How to Use

Once the assistant is running, it will greet you and wait for your voice commands. You can say things like:

- "Open Google"
- "Play music on YouTube"
- "Search for Albert Einstein on Wikipedia"
- "Take a screenshot"
- "Shutdown the system"

The assistant will respond by performing the corresponding task. If it doesn't recognize your command, it will ask you to repeat.

### Commands

The assistant can handle the following commands:

- **Search Wikipedia**: "What is [your query]" or "Who is [your query]"
- **Web Search**: "Open Google" or "Search [query] on Google"
- **YouTube**: "Open YouTube" or "Play [video] on YouTube"
- **System Control**: "Shutdown the system", "Restart the system", "Lock the PC"
- **Screenshot**: "Take a screenshot"
- **Open Applications**: "Open Command Prompt", "Open Chrome", etc.
